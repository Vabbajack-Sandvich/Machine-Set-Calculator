# Machine Set Calculator


# Important:


I don't plan on maintaining this past it's usefulness.

I don't plan on helping people with problems.

I don't plan on making a tutorial video.

I thought this was a useful tool for calculating machine through put that would be valulable to others so I'm sharing it.


# About:



TLDR: This makes it easy to change the numbers around until you get the percent you want.


=================================================================


This calculates through put like this:


=================================================================


p = individual machine parts per minute number

n = number of machines in the set

b = the total output of all the machines at the base parts per minute number which gets calculated automatically

d = desired new input intended to be put through all the machines

o = output percent to set each machine in the set to


=================================================================


b = p * n

o = (d / b) * 100
